# hangman-game

"Thalassophobia," an ocean-themed javascript hangman demo. The player tries to guess the mystery word, one letter at a time. Each miss adds a tentacle to the Kraken, represented by custom graphics with access-conscious alt text to convey the otherwise visual information for the visually impaired. If the Kraken grows all its tentacles and awakens, the player loses; if the player instead completes the word before the Kraken finishes reconstituting, the game is won and the Kraken retreats into the deep.

This version distinguishes itself with strong mobile utility in the form of an onscreen keyboard; players can either type letters to guess them if on a full website, or click key buttons displayed along the side of the screen if playing on a touch screen. There's also an extra element of value in multiple difficulty settings, allowing players to choose between easier words or ones that are much more difficult due to obscurity to players unfamiliar with marine science or simply via punishingly short length.
