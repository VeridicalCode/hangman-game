## What Is This Thing?
An ocean-themed Hangman-style game written in Javascript. The player attempts to guess a mystery word, one letter at a time. Each wrong letter adds a tentacle to the Kraken; guessing the word before the Kraken awakens causes it to retreat back into the depths, while allowing it to regrow all its tentacles and consume the player results in a loss.

## What's Special About It?
- The game is mobile-friendly; players can guess letters either by keypress, or by clicking appropriate letters along the side of the screen if they're on a utility with no physical keyboard.
- The game is access-conscious; each tentacle has descriptive alt-text, helping users with visual impairment keep track of how many tentacles are present.
- The game has a difficulty setting; players may choose between a set of easier, common words, or a set that is more difficult due to length, composition, or obscurity to players unfamiliar with marine science.

## How Do I Use It?
Open the page, select a difficulty, and go!

## Who Made It?
All local code was written solely by myself, Mars Getsoian.

## Are There Bugs?
Button sorting on shorter screens can cause letters at the end of the alphabet to be cut off until earlier letters have been guessed.
