# hangman-game

"Thalassophobia," an ocean-themed javascript hangman demo. The player tries to guess the mystery word, one letter at a time. Each miss adds a tentacle to the Kraken, which 'consumes' the player (currently no animation for this, just use your imagination). If the player completes the word before the Kraken finishes reconstituting, the game is won and the Kraken retreats into the deep.
