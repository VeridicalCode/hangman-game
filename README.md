# hangman-game

"Thalassophobia," an ocean-themed javascript hangman demo. The player tries to guess the mystery word, one letter at a time. Each miss adds a tentacle to the Kraken, which consumes the user's little scuba-diving avatar once it reaches eight tentacles. If the user completes the word before the Kraken finishes reconstituting, the little scuba guy escapes.

A few things set this apart from the baseline Hangman game:

a) The ocean theme

b) Multiple source word arrays, allowing the player to select different difficulties

c) If the player figures out the word early, they can guess the full word insted of finishing off one letter at a time
